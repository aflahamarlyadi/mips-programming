# MIPS Programming

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of algorithms implemented in MIPS Assembly Language, alongside their Python counterparts for comparison.

## Directory

`binary_search/` contains the Binary Search algorithm in MIPS Assembly Language and Python.

`insertion_sort/` contains the Insertion Sort algorithm in MIPS Assembly Language and Python.


## Getting Started

To explore the MIPS Assembly programs:

1. Download and install the MARS IDE from the [official site](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/).
2. Open the `.asm` files in MARS to view or run the code.

To explore the Python implementations:
